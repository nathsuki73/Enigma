# Enigma Console Program

## Description
This Enigma Console Program, developed using Visual Studio, simulates the operations of the historic Enigma machine famously used during World War II for encryption and decryption of messages. The program is written in C# and replicates the core functionality of the Enigma machine, allowing users to input messages and apply various settings for encryption or decryption.

## Features
- Simulates the Enigma machine's rotor settings and plugboard configurations.
- Accepts user input for messages and settings to perform encryption/decryption.
- Provides a basic yet interactive experience of encoding and decoding messages.
